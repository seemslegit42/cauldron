# Lore™ - Collective Intelligence & Knowledge Management Module

Lore™ is the Knowledge Management module of the Cauldron™ sEOS, serving as the collective intelligence and organizational memory system. It transforms disparate information into a unified, accessible, and evolving knowledge ecosystem that enhances decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Overview

Lore™ creates an "Ambient Organizational Memory" by integrating document management, knowledge graphs, vector search, and AI-powered retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. It serves as the central repository for organizational knowledge, making information discoverable, contextual, and actionable.

## Key Features

- **Document Management**: Secure storage, versioning, and organization of documents
- **Knowledge Graph**: Entity extraction, relationship mapping, and semantic connections
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search capabilities using embeddings
- **RAG System**: AI-powered question answering and content generation
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Automated summarization and insight generation
- **Skill Mapping**: Identification and tracking of organizational expertise

## Architecture

Lore™ is implemented as a custom Frappe application (`cauldron_lore`) with the following components:

1. **Document Store**: Integration with Nextcloud for document storage and management
2. **Vector Database**: Qdrant or PGVector for semantic search capabilities
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Graph database for entity and relationship management
4. **RAG Engine**: LLM integration for question answering and content generation
5. **API Layer**: RESTful APIs for integration with other Cauldron™ modules

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Document management, basic search, and initial knowledge graph
2. **Phase 2**: Vector search, RAG capabilities, and expanded knowledge graph
3. **Phase 3**: Knowledge synthesis, skill mapping, and autonomous knowledge curation

## Integration Points

- **Manifold UI**: User interface for knowledge management and search
- **Mythos EDA**: Event-driven updates to the knowledge base
- **Operations Core**: Contextual information for business processes
- **AetherCore / AI Agents**: Knowledge source for agent operations
- **Synapse**: Enrichment of business intelligence with contextual knowledge
- **Aegis Protocol**: Security-related knowledge and documentation

## Security & Governance

- **Access Control**: Role-based access to knowledge assets
- **Data Classification**: Automatic classification of sensitive information
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of knowledge access and modifications
- **Privacy Protection**: Redaction and anonymization of sensitive data
- **Ethical Use**: Guidelines for responsible use of organizational knowledge
