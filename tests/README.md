This directory contains test suites and testing utilities for the Cauldron project, ensuring code quality, functionality, and reliability across the system.

## Test Categories

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual components and functions
- `integration/` - Integration tests for interactions between components
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- `performance/` - Performance and load tests

- JavaScript/TypeScript tests use Jest
- API tests use Postman/Newman
- End-to-end tests use Cypress or Playwright

## Running Tests

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline on pull requests and before deployments. See the GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` for details.

## Writing Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. Write tests before implementing the feature (TDD approach)
2. Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external services
3. Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Aim for high code coverage, especially for critical paths

## Test Data

- Use fixtures for test data when possible
- Avoid hardcoding test data
- Clean up test data after tests complete

## Continuous Improvement

The test suite is continuously improved to:

- Increase coverage
- Reduce test execution time
- Improve test reliability
- Enhance test reporting
