# Cauldron sEOS Database Schema Design

This document outlines the comprehensive database schema design for the Cauldron sEOS platform, incorporating PostgreSQL as the foundation with integrations for Supabase, vector database capabilities (PGVector), and time-series functionality (TimescaleDB).

## Architecture Overview

The database architecture is designed with the following key components:

1. **PostgreSQL Core**: The foundation of the database system, providing robust relational database capabilities.
2. **Vector Database (PGVector)**: Integrated for semantic search and knowledge management.
3. **Time-Series Database (TimescaleDB)**: For efficient storage and querying of time-series metrics and events.
4. **Supabase Integration**: For authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities.

## Schema Organization

The database is organized into multiple schemas to logically separate different functional areas:

### Core Schemas

- **public**: Core tables for users, roles, permissions, organizations, and system settings
- **erp**: ERPNext core tables
- **hr**: HR module tables
- **crm**: CRM module tables

### Cauldron sEOS Module Schemas

- **command_cauldron**: Command & Cauldron module for AI Software Development & Autonomous DevOps
- **synapse**: Synapse module for Predictive & Prescriptive Business Intelligence
- **aegis**: Aegis Protocol module for Proactive & Autonomous Cybersecurity
- **lore**: Lore module for Collective Intelligence & Knowledge Synthesis

### Technical Schemas

- **vector**: Vector embeddings using PGVector
- **timeseries**: Time-series data using TimescaleDB
- **audit**: Audit and logging tables
- **admin**: Administrative functions and procedures
- **supabase**: Supabase integration tables and functions
- **realtime**: Supabase Realtime functionality
- **storage**: Supabase Storage functionality
- **auth**: Supabase Auth functionality
- **analytics**: Analytics and reporting
- **integration**: External system integrations

## Key Components

### 1. Core User Management

The core user management system includes:

- User accounts and profiles
- Role-based access control
- Organizations and teams
- API tokens and sessions
- System and user settings

### 2. Vector Database (PGVector)

The vector database capabilities are primarily implemented in the `lore` schema:

- Document storage and chunking
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Knowledge graph with entities and relationships
- Similarity search using HNSW indexes

Key features:
- Efficient storage of high-dimensional vectors (1536 dimensions)
- Fast similarity search using HNSW indexes
- Integration with full-text search for hybrid retrieval

### 3. Time-Series Database (TimescaleDB)

Time-series functionality is implemented in the `timeseries` schema:

- System metrics collection
- User activity tracking
- Business KPIs and metrics
- Agent performance metrics

Key features:
- Automatic partitioning by time (hypertables)
- Continuous aggregates for efficient querying
- Retention policies for data lifecycle management

### 4. Supabase Integration

Supabase integration is implemented across multiple schemas:

- **auth**: User authentication and management
- **storage**: File storage and management
- **realtime**: Real-time subscriptions and notifications
- **supabase**: Integration functions and utilities

### 5. Agent System

The agent system is implemented in the `command_cauldron` schema:

- AI agents and their configurations
- Agent executions and history
- Tools and capabilities
- Workflows for agent orchestration

### 6. Integration Layer

The integration layer is implemented in the `integration` schema:

- External system connections
- Data synchronization jobs
- Event bus for system integration

## Performance Optimizations

The schema includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Indexes**: Comprehensive indexing strategy for all tables
2. **Vector Indexes**: HNSW indexes for efficient similarity search
3. **Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for large tables
4. **Continuous Aggregates**: Pre-computed aggregates for time-series data
5. **Full-Text Search**: GIN indexes for text search capabilities

## Security Features

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions system
2. **Row-Level Security**: For multi-tenant data isolation
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all actions
4. **Encryption**: Support for encrypted data storage

## Backup and Recovery

The schema includes support for:

1. **WAL Archiving**: For point-in-time recovery
2. **Backup Procedures**: Automated backup processes
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Procedures for system restoration

## Extensibility

The schema is designed to be extensible:

1. **Modular Design**: Separate schemas for different functional areas
2. **Migration Tracking**: Schema version control
3. **Extension Support**: Easy integration of additional PostgreSQL extensions

## Setup and Maintenance

The complete database schema can be set up using the provided SQL scripts:

1. Create the database:
   ```
   createdb cauldron_seos
   ```

2. Apply the schema:
   ```
   psql -d cauldron_seos -f database_schema.sql
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```
   psql -d cauldron_seos -c "SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;"
   ```

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 15+
- TimescaleDB extension
- PGVector extension
- PostGIS extension (optional, for geospatial capabilities)
- pgRouting extension (optional, for graph operations)

## Conclusion

This database schema provides a comprehensive foundation for the Cauldron sEOS platform, combining the strengths of PostgreSQL, vector databases, time-series databases, and Supabase to create a powerful and flexible data layer for enterprise operations.
