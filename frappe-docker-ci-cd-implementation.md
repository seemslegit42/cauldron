# Frappe Docker CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented the initial CI/CD pipeline stage for building Frappe Docker images for the Cauldron project. This implementation provides an automated way to build, tag, and publish Docker images for the Frappe/ERPNext components of the system.

## Components Created

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-frappe-images.yml`):
   - Automated pipeline for building and publishing Docker images
   - Triggered by code changes, pull requests, or manual dispatch
   - Builds base, app-specific, and complete images
   - Updates Helm chart values with new image tags

2. **Local Build Script** (`scripts/build-frappe-images.sh`):
   - Script for building Docker images locally
   - Supports various options for customization
   - Useful for development and testing

3. **Documentation**:
   - Pipeline documentation (`codex/ci-cd/frappe-docker-images-pipeline.md`)
   - Frappe Docker README (`frappe/README.md`)

## Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline follows a multi-stage approach:

1. **Build Base Image**: Creates a foundation image with Frappe Bench and dependencies
2. **Build App-Specific Images**: Creates images for each Cauldron app
3. **Build Complete Image**: Creates a comprehensive image with all apps
4. **Update Helm Chart**: Updates Helm chart values with new image tags

## Key Features

### 1. Environment-Specific Builds

The pipeline supports building images for different environments:
- **Development**: Developer mode enabled, minimal optimization
- **Staging**: Intermediate optimization
- **Production**: Full optimization, developer mode disabled

### 2. Flexible Tagging Strategy

Images are tagged using a comprehensive strategy:
- Version-based tags (e.g., `latest`, `1.0.0`)
- Branch-based tags (e.g., `main`, `develop`)
- Commit-based tags (e.g., `sha-a1b2c3d`)

### 3. Caching and Optimization

The pipeline uses Docker BuildKit features for:
- Layer caching to speed up builds
- Parallel building of multiple images
- Efficient use of GitHub Actions runners

### 4. Integration with Helm

The pipeline automatically updates Helm chart values, ensuring:
- Consistent image references across the deployment
- Automated tracking of image versions
- Simplified deployment process

## Usage

### GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow can be triggered:

1. **Automatically**: When changes are pushed to `frappe/` directory
2. **Manually**: Using the GitHub Actions UI with custom parameters:
   - Version tag
   - Target environment (dev, staging, prod)

### Local Development

For local development, use the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/build-frappe-images.sh --environment dev
```

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security features:

- Images are built using Docker BuildKit for improved security
- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) is used for secure image storage
- Proper permissions are set for GitHub Actions workflows
- Environment-specific builds to minimize attack surface in production

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Integration**: Add automated testing of the built images
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate container security scanning
3. **Multi-Architecture Support**: Add support for multiple CPU architectures
4. **Deployment Automation**: Extend the pipeline to include deployment stages
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Add monitoring and alerting for the pipeline

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Frappe Docker CI/CD pipeline. It automates the build and publication process, supports different environments, and integrates with the existing Helm-based deployment system. The pipeline is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements as the project evolves.
