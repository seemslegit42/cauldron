This directory contains the microservices architecture components of the Cauldron project.

## Structure

- Each subdirectory represents a separate microservice
- Each microservice should be self-contained with its own:
  - Source code
  - Dockerfile
  - Configuration files
  - Tests
  - Documentation

## Microservices

- `aether-core/` - Core orchestration service
- `synapse/` - Integration and data processing service
- `lore/` - Knowledge management service
- `operations/` - Operations management service
