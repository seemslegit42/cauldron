# Coder - Development Environment Service

This directory contains the configuration and setup for the Coder service, which provides remote development environments for the Cauldron project.

## Overview

Coder is a self-hosted platform that creates and manages remote development environments. It enables developers to work in consistent, pre-configured environments that are accessible from anywhere, improving collaboration and reducing "works on my machine" issues.

## Features

- Remote development environments with VS Code or JetBrains IDEs
- Pre-configured tools and dependencies
- Consistent environment for all developers
- Resource management and scaling
- Access control and security

## Configuration

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the base development environment
- `entrypoint.sh`: Initialization script for the Coder environment
- Configuration files for IDE settings and extensions

## Usage

### Starting a Development Environment

1. Access the Coder dashboard
2. Create a new workspace based on the Cauldron template
3. Connect using your preferred IDE (VS Code, JetBrains)
4. Start developing with all tools and dependencies pre-installed

### Customizing Your Environment

Developers can customize their environments by:

- Installing additional tools and extensions
- Configuring IDE preferences
- Setting up personal dotfiles

## Integration with CI/CD

The Coder environments are designed to work seamlessly with the Cauldron CI/CD pipeline:

- Consistent environment between development and CI/CD
- Shared configuration and dependencies
- Reproducible builds and tests

## Security Considerations

- All environments are containerized for isolation
- Access control through authentication and authorization
- Secure communication with TLS
- Regular updates and security patches
