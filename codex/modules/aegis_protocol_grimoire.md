# Module Grimoire: Aegis Protocol™ (Autonomous Security) V1.0

## 1. Overview & Purpose

The **Aegis Protocol™** module serves as the dedicated cybersecurity brain and adaptive immune system for the Cauldron™ sEOS. It aims to provide unified security visibility, orchestrate threat detection and response, manage vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and progressively introduce AI-driven automation and autonomy to security operations.

**Analogy:** The Guardian Shield – Proactively defends, detects threats, and coordinates the immune response.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Ingesting security logs and events from various sources (Cauldron™ modules, infrastructure, endpoints, external tools).
    *   Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) functionalities (correlation, analysis, alerting).
    *   Threat detection (rule-based, anomaly-based, potentially ML-driven).
    *   Incident response orchestration (defining playbooks/runbooks, coordinating actions across modules/agents).
    *   Vulnerability management (ingesting scan data, tracking remediation).
    *   Compliance monitoring and reporting against defined frameworks.
    *   Security posture management.
    *   (Ambitious Goals) AI-driven threat hunting, autonomous incident containment/remediation, continuous validation (e.g., PhishFamiliar).
    *   Implementation as a custom Frappe App (`cauldron_aegis_protocol`).
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Acting as the primary firewall, WAF, or endpoint protection agent (it integrates with these, but doesn't replace them).
    *   Core business operations (Handled by **Operations Core**).
    *   General BI/Prediction (Handled by **Synapse**, though Aegis performs security-specific analysis).
    *   General knowledge management/RAG (Handled by **Lore**, though Aegis may use it for context).
    *   DevOps automation (Handled by **Command & Cauldron**, though Aegis integrates for DevSecOps).

## 3. Key Features & Functionalities (Phased Approach)

*   **Phase 1 (Foundation & Visibility):**
    *   Define core DocTypes: `SecurityEvent`, `SecurityAlert`, `SecurityIncident`, `Vulnerability`, `ComplianceControl`, `Asset`.
    *   Implement connectors to ingest logs/events from key sources via Mythos or direct integrations (e.g., infrastructure logs, Operations Core audit trails, C&C deployment events).
    *   Basic event correlation rules engine.
    *   Manual incident creation and tracking workflow within Aegis DocTypes.
    *   Basic dashboards in Manifold showing alert counts, incident status, key security events.
    *   Publish critical alerts (`security.alert.high`) to Mythos.
*   **Phase 2 (Orchestration & Enrichment):**
    *   Develop basic incident response playbooks (defined as data/scripts, potentially Relics).
    *   Integrate with AetherCore to allow manual triggering of simple response actions via agents (e.g., agent isolates a container via C&C API, agent fetches logs). HITL required.
    *   Integrate vulnerability scanner results (e.g., Nessus, Trivy) into `Vulnerability` DocType.
    *   Use Lore (via API/events) to enrich alerts/incidents with contextual information (e.g., asset owner, known vulnerabilities).
    *   Develop basic compliance checks against configured controls.
    *   Introduce anomaly detection algorithms (statistical or simple ML) for specific log types.
*   **Phase 3+ (Towards Autonomy - Very High Risk/Complexity):**
    *   **Unified Security Brain (Conceptual Goal):** Advanced correlation across diverse data sources (logs, threat intel, user behavior), leveraging Synapse potentially for predictive threat modeling.
    *   **Autonomous Defense Network (Conceptual Goal):** AI agents automatically executing predefined response playbooks for specific high-confidence alerts (e.g., blocking an IP, isolating a host, disabling a user account). Requires extremely robust guardrails, mandatory HITL for broader actions initially, potential integration with C&C for automated patching/reconfiguration.
    *   **Continuous Validation Engine (Conceptual Goal):** Agents like **PhishFamiliar** proactively testing defenses (simulated phishing, vulnerability checks) and feeding results back into Aegis.
    *   **AI-Driven Threat Hunting (Conceptual Goal):** Agents proactively searching logs and data streams for subtle signs of compromise based on learned patterns or hypothesis generation.
    *   **Requires:** Advanced AI/ML for security, extensive testing ("chaos security engineering"), mature incident response playbooks, extremely reliable integrations, sophisticated guardrails, Ethics Council review for autonomous actions.

## 4. Technical Architecture & Implementation

*   **Framework:** Frappe Framework (Python).
*   **Custom Code:** Resides within the `cauldron_aegis_protocol` Frappe App.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Custom DocTypes:** `SecurityEvent`, `SecurityAlert`, `SecurityIncident`, `Vulnerability`, `ComplianceControl`, `Asset`, `ThreatIntel`, `ResponsePlaybook`.
    *   **Event Consumers (Python):** Ingest and normalize security events from Mythos topics (`security.events.raw`, etc.).
    *   **Correlation Engine (Python):** Implement logic (rules, potentially ML models) to correlate events and generate alerts.
    *   **Server Scripts (Python):** Implement incident management workflows, compliance checks, playbook execution logic.
    *   **API Endpoints (Python):** Expose API for Manifold (dashboards, incident details), potentially for agents reporting findings or receiving orchestration commands.
    *   **Scheduled Jobs (Python):** Periodic tasks like running compliance checks, checking threat intel feeds, data aggregation.
    *   **Integration Connectors (Python):** Code to pull data from external security tools (scanners, threat intel feeds) if not available via Mythos.

## 5. Data Model

*   Relies heavily on custom DocTypes defined within `cauldron_aegis_protocol` to model security entities.
*   May store normalized event summaries, alert details, incident timelines, vulnerability data, compliance status.
*   Raw logs might be stored externally (e.g., dedicated log management system, Time-Series DB) and referenced from Aegis DocTypes.

## 6. Integration Points

*   **Manifold UI:** Via REST APIs for security dashboards, alert triage, incident management, compliance reporting.
*   **Mythos EDA:** Consumes raw security events, operational events, deployment events; Publishes alerts, incident status changes, compliance notifications.
*   **AetherCore / AI Agents:** Agents (e.g., PhishFamiliar, remediation agents) tasked by AetherCore based on Aegis triggers/playbooks. Agents report results via Mythos/API.
*   **Operations Core:** Consumes events relevant for fraud detection or operational security monitoring.
*   **Command & Cauldron:** Consumes deployment/infra events; Aegis provides security scan results/alerts; Aegis might trigger C&C actions (via API/EDA) for remediation (e.g., patching, config changes).
*   **Lore:** Aegis uses Lore for contextual enrichment of alerts/incidents.
*   **Synapse:** Aegis might consume anomaly detection results from Synapse; Synapse might consume aggregated security data for higher-level risk modeling.
*   **External Security Tools:** Integrates with firewalls, IDS/IPS, EDR, vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence feeds, etc., via direct APIs, scripts, or potentially n8n for simpler cases.

## 7. Security & Governance Considerations

*   **Data Sensitivity:** Security logs and incident data are highly sensitive. Implement strict access controls (Frappe roles) and potentially data encryption at rest.
*   **Autonomous Response Risk:** Autonomous actions (blocking IPs, isolating hosts, disabling users) carry significant operational risk. MUST start with mandatory HITL, implement strong guardrails ("blast radius" limits), require extensive testing in simulated environments, and gain explicit Ethics Council approval for specific automated responses.
*   **Alert Fatigue:** Poorly tuned correlation or anomaly detection can lead to excessive alerts. Requires careful tuning and prioritization logic.
*   **Playbook Reliability:** Automated response playbooks must be thoroughly tested and maintained to ensure they execute correctly and don't cause unintended harm.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure Aegis processes and data retention align with relevant compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.).

Aegis Protocol™ is the vigilant protector, requiring a blend of broad visibility, intelligent analysis, and extremely cautious implementation of automation and autonomy.
