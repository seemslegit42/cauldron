# Cauldron™ Integration Fabric: Event-Driven Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Integration Fabric for the Cauldron™ Sentient Enterprise Operating System (sEOS), implementing an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) with Kafka or RabbitMQ as the core message broker, supplemented by REST APIs and potentially n8n for workflow automation. This architecture enables loose coupling between components, real-time reactivity, and scalable communication patterns that support the autonomous and intelligent nature of the system.

## 1. Integration Architecture Principles

### 1.1 Event-Driven Design

The Cauldron™ integration fabric is built on event-driven principles:

- **Loose Coupling**: Components interact without direct dependencies
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Non-blocking interactions between services
- **Event Sourcing**: Capturing state changes as a sequence of events
- **Reactive Systems**: Components respond to events in real-time
- **Scalable Patterns**: Communication patterns that scale horizontally

### 1.2 API-First Approach

Complementing the event-driven core with API-first principles:

- **Consistent Interfaces**: Standardized API design across the system
- **Self-Documenting**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all APIs
- **Versioned Contracts**: Ensuring backward compatibility
- **Resource-Oriented**: RESTful design for resource operations
- **Security by Design**: Authentication and authorization at the API level

## 2. Event Bus Implementation (Mythos)

### 2.1 Message Broker Selection

The event bus can be implemented with either:

#### 2.1.1 Apache Kafka

Recommended for high-throughput scenarios:

- **Distributed Commit Log**: Durable, ordered event storage
- **High Throughput**: Handling millions of events per second
- **Topic Partitioning**: Horizontal scaling of event processing
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable event persistence
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Reliable event processing

#### 2.1.2 RabbitMQ

Recommended for complex routing scenarios:

- **Advanced Routing**: Sophisticated message routing patterns
- **Multiple Protocols**: AMQP, MQTT, STOMP support
- **Exchange Types**: Direct, fanout, topic, and header exchanges
- **Message Queuing**: Reliable delivery to consumers
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensible functionality

### 2.2 Event Bus Architecture

The Mythos event bus architecture includes:

- **Event Producers**: Services that publish events
- **Event Consumers**: Services that subscribe to events
- **Topics/Exchanges**: Channels for event distribution
- **Consumer Groups**: Scaling event processing
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handling failed event processing
- **Schema Registry**: Ensuring event format consistency
- **Event Store**: Persisting events for replay and analysis

### 2.3 Event Schema Management

Standardized event schemas ensure consistent interpretation:

- **Schema Registry**: Central repository of event schemas
- **Schema Evolution**: Versioning and compatibility rules
- **Schema Validation**: Ensuring events conform to schemas
- **Schema Documentation**: Self-documenting event formats
- **Code Generation**: Generating client code from schemas

## 3. Event Types and Patterns

### 3.1 Event Categories

Events are categorized into types:

- **Domain Events**: Representing business state changes
- **Command Events**: Triggering specific actions
- **Query Events**: Requesting information
- **Notification Events**: Informing about system activities
- **Integration Events**: Facilitating cross-system communication

### 3.2 Event Structure

Standard event structure includes:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "event.domain.action",
  "source": "service-name",
  "time": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "dataContentType": "application/json",
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "entity": "entity-type",
    "entityId": "entity-identifier",
    "action": "created|updated|deleted",
    "payload": {
      // Event-specific data
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid",
    "causationId": "uuid",
    "userId": "user-identifier",
    "tenantId": "tenant-identifier"
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Communication Patterns

The integration fabric supports multiple communication patterns:

#### 3.3.1 Publish-Subscribe

- **One-to-Many**: Events distributed to multiple subscribers
- **Topic-Based**: Subscribers filter by topic/subject
- **Content-Based**: Subscribers filter by event content
- **Broadcast**: Delivering events to all interested parties
- **Fan-Out**: Distributing work across multiple consumers

#### 3.3.2 Request-Reply

- **Asynchronous Request**: Request as an event, response as another event
- **Correlation IDs**: Linking requests and responses
- **Timeout Handling**: Managing response timeouts
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests across responders
- **Circuit Breaking**: Handling service unavailability

#### 3.3.3 Event Sourcing

- **Event Streams**: Capturing all state changes as events
- **Event Store**: Persisting events as the system of record
- **State Reconstruction**: Building current state from event history
- **Event Replay**: Reconstructing state at any point in time
- **Snapshotting**: Optimizing state reconstruction

#### 3.3.4 Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

- **Command Side**: Handling state changes via commands
- **Query Side**: Optimized read models for queries
- **Eventual Consistency**: Asynchronous synchronization between sides
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed query results
- **Read Model Projections**: Building specialized read models from events

## 4. REST API Complement

### 4.1 API Gateway

The API Gateway manages all API traffic:

- **Routing**: Directing requests to appropriate services
- **Authentication**: Verifying client identity
- **Authorization**: Enforcing access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse
- **Request Transformation**: Adapting client requests
- **Response Transformation**: Formatting service responses
- **Caching**: Improving performance for repeated requests

### 4.2 API Design Principles

REST APIs follow consistent design principles:

- **Resource-Oriented**: Modeling domain entities as resources
- **Standard Methods**: Using HTTP verbs consistently (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Predictable URLs**: Following consistent URL patterns
- **Query Parameters**: Standardized filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Status Codes**: Appropriate HTTP status codes for responses
- **Hypermedia**: HATEOAS links for resource relationships
- **Content Negotiation**: Supporting multiple formats (JSON, XML)
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format

### 4.3 API Versioning

API versioning ensures backward compatibility:

- **URL Versioning**: Including version in the URL path
- **Header Versioning**: Specifying version in request headers
- **Content Type Versioning**: Including version in content type
- **Parameter Versioning**: Passing version as a query parameter
- **Deprecation Process**: Graceful retirement of old versions
