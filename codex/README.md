# Cauldron™ Codex - Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Codex, the central repository for all documentation related to the Cauldron™ Sentient Enterprise Operating System (sEOS) project. This collection of scrolls, diagrams, and guides serves as the ground truth for understanding Cauldron's architecture, usage, governance, and development.

Whether you are a Warden guiding the sEOS, a developer forging new capabilities, or an AI Construct seeking context, this Codex is your primary source of knowledge.

## Directory Structure

The Codex is organized into the following sections to facilitate navigation:

* **`/architecture`**: Contains high-level system design documents, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), diagrams (like the Nexus Map), and explanations of core architectural patterns (Data Layer, Integration Fabric, etc.).
* **`/apis`**: Houses detailed specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger definitions) and usage guides for the various REST APIs exposed by Cauldron's services and modules.
* **`/governance`**: Includes critical documents related to ethical AI principles, the Ethics Council charter, agent operational guardrails, security policies, and compliance information.
* **`/guides`**: Provides practical "how-to" guides for various tasks, such as setting up the development environment, contributing code, using specific features or tools (like Backstage), authentication procedures, and UI theming.
* **`/modules`**: Contains detailed documentation specific to each core Cauldron™ module (`Synapse`, `Aegis Protocol`, `Lore`, `Command & Cauldron`, `Operations Core`), covering their design, functionality, configuration, and internal workings.
* **`/security`**: (Optional/Evolving) May contain detailed security configurations, procedures, Zero Trust implementation specifics, and secrets management strategies.

*(Refer to the README within each subdirectory for more specific contents.)*

## Target Audience

This documentation is intended for:

* **Project Leads / Wardens:** To understand the system conceptually, track progress, and make informed strategic decisions.
* **Developers / Contributors:** To understand the architecture, APIs, coding standards, and how to contribute effectively.
* **AI Coding Agents:** To gain context about the codebase, architecture, naming conventions, and integration patterns.
* **Potential Users / Adopters:** To learn about Cauldron's capabilities, architecture, and usage.

## Maintenance

This Codex is a living entity. Please strive to keep documentation up-to-date as the Cauldron™ platform evolves. Use clear Markdown formatting. Contributions and corrections are welcome (refer to contribution guidelines if available).

## Backstage Integration

The structure and content within this `codex/` directory are designed to be compatible with [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/)'s TechDocs feature, allowing this documentation to be rendered as a browsable portal within the Cauldron™ developer platform.
