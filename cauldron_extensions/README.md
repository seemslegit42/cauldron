These extensions enable specialized functionality, third-party integrations, and custom features that may not be part of the core platform.

## Extension Categories

- **API Extensions**: Additional API endpoints and integrations
- **UI Components**: Custom UI elements and widgets for Manifold
- **Workflow Extensions**: Custom workflow actions and triggers
- **Integration Adapters**: Connectors for third-party systems
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions and shared utilities
- **Custom DocTypes**: Additional data models for specialized use cases
